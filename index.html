        <p>Hello, and welcome to my <a href="https://github.com/AlexVild">Github</a> page! From here you can check out my projects that I've hosted on           Github and get to know a little bit about me.</p>
        
        <p><center><img src="src/ohio_university_logo_outline.png" style="max-width: 25%"></center></p>
            
        <p>I am a sophomore computer science student at Ohio University. The computer science curriculum at OU starts us with programming
        immediately with a programming class the first semester of our freshman year. To date I have taken two introductory C++ programming
        classes, Discrete Math, Data Structures, and classes in Software Tools and Organizations of Programming languages.</p>

        <p>As I've stated, I have a lot of experience in C++. On my Github you can find a couple of console applications I wrote in C++. One of
        these projects is a Unix command line Checkers game that I made for my CS2401 class' final project. The other is Sightreader, a small
        program I made to help myself learn how to sightread piano sheet music. I also have experience with Java, HTML/CSS, and Python.</p>
