                <p>
                    I am a senior Computer Science student at Ohio University. So far in our courses,
                    we have covered the basics of C++ programming, Discrete Mathematics and Data Structures,
                    Compilers, Operating Systems, Parallel Computing, and AI, as well as other classes in fields such
                    as Calculus, Probability and Statistics, Physics, and Plant Biology.
                </p>
                <p> For our curriculum's capstone senior design class, 5 fellow students and I are working on the natural language
                    processing and pathfinding abilities of a robotic bobcat developed largely using Android Studio.

                    I have worked at <a href="https://www.ohio.edu/oit/">OIT</a> (OHIO Information Technology) for
                    a year and a half as a Student Software Engineer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the summer of 2016, I worked as a full time intern at OIT, where I worked with a small team to create an Angular/NodeJS application that services over 20,000 customers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my free time, I like to create small web apps for the things I am into! I also
                    love to play music, and am in a band where I sing and play guitar. I would like
                    to combine these two loves some time, and now that I have much more experience
                    working with web development I hope to create more useful custom applications in the future.
