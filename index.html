                        I am a software developer, currently working in the Columbus, Ohio area. I graduated from Ohio University in the Spring of 2017, so I'm still
                        relatively new to the life of being a software developer- but hey, that means you can pay me less!

                        My abilities as a programmer were molded primarily from my school's curriculum and the jobs I've worked. I am proficient in C++, Java, Groovy, Python,
                        NodeJS, AngularJS (and vanilla Javascript), and HTML/CSS. I am familiar with the Agile development methodology and using the version control system Git.

                        From 2015-2017, I held a job at the  <a href="https://www.ohio.edu/oit/">Ohio University Information Technology</a>
                        office, where I learned all about proper software design practices and the world of web development. I am currently employed at <a href="http://ijus.net/">IJUS</a>, a utility
                        contracting service, where I develop solutions to the problems that the engineers face using the supplied software stack.

                        I am constantly seeking to be challenged in an effort to better my abilities as a programmer. I am at my best when I am working
                        in a team with a shared vision, with each member of the team following proper development practices. Clean, well documented, and well-tested code will
                        always provide a better experience for everyone involved, and it is important to me to be on a team that realizes this.

                        I am a quick learner, and have been thrust into unfamiliar territories with regards to software development many times. I enjoy the challenge and
                        love to learn new languages and practices that make me a better developer.

                        I worked at OIT as a student software developer for 2 years. Primarily, my tasks were to implement small features into existing code bases- things such as
                        using local storage to store form information, or implementing pagination on search results. Mid-way through my employment, I was given the opportunity to
                        be a proper intern there, where I worked on updating a legacy ColdFusion applicaton to a much more mordern and maintainable Node/Angular application,
                        that was responsible for servicing all students and faculty with university account creation and management.

                        Currently at IJUS my tasks typically revolve around the needs of the engineers. I have created multiple spell checking plugins, in Groovy and in Python,
                        have maintained a groovy script used to update millions of entries in a database, and created BIRT reports to assist the administrative branch of the company.

                        In our courses, we covered Object-Oriented Programming, Discrete Mathematics, Algorithmic Analysis, Data Structures,
                        Compilers, Operating Systems, Parallel Computing, Databases, and AI- as well as other classes in fields such
                        as Calculus, Linear Algebra, Number Theory, Probability and Statistics, Physics, and Plant Biology.

                        For our curriculum's capstone senior design class, 5 fellow students and I worked on the natural language
                        processing and pathfinding abilities of a robotic bobcat developed largely using Android Studio. The results of our
                        efforts can be found in the <a href="#projects">"My Projects"</a> section of this web page.
